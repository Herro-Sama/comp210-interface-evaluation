          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
		The results I received I feel were unfortunately inconclusive and weren't particularly suitable for use in answering the main question. This is largely due to the fact that the users weren't separated into two groups and instead were allowed freedom to make their own choices about how to play the game presenting an issue with getting a sizable results base to draw a conclusion. 

		However it could be argued that splitting the users into two separate groups could remove a key part in user mind set, but this is only a theoretical bias but it is worth mentioning for consideration in future user testing scenarios.

		The main result I have found was about the practical nature of the games UI as the majority of users didn't notice the all of the UI elements for the game through normal play, one of the major changes to the UI is to keep it more central to the screen rather than locked away in the corners. It's my understanding from the results I did get that users didn't spend a lot of time looking around the screen instead tending to only look at the obstacles directly ahead of them. This idea could be tested with the use of any eye tracking equipment, it's also worth noting that in any future tests a question worth asking is how heavily did not noticing the UI effect their overall enjoyment of the game.
