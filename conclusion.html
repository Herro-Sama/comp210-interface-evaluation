          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
		Although I was able to get some results from my research I found that my set up for gathering research was potentially unfairly biased. The methods however did prove effective and had the testing period been more controlled and done in batches of users who were told to read the instructions against users who were told not to read the instructions. The results could have been more fair, although preliminary candidate screening would be necessary to ensure that both participating groups were not completely separate. One of the main issues with my methodology was that I didn't have a large enough test group I feel and if I were to redo this study I would aim for a much larger test group.

		The results I received were not quite what I was expecting as very few users actually looked at the instructions for the game, however some did look at the instructions after their first attempt, though with prior experience with the game the results of this session would be invalid as a result of them already having experience with the game. 

		The initial assumption for the question of do users who read the instructions also have a higher chance of identifying all the UI elements on screen, I had expect a more conclusive result from my testing which would show users who took the time to understand the controls and the game, would also take some time to observe more of the on-screen elements. 

		I didn't account for the lack of users reading the instructions but using the results I received it could be said that the results show there is no correlation between users reading the instructions and being able to identify the UI elements.

		The results I received I feel were unfortunately inconclusive and weren't particularly suitable for use in answering the main question. This is largely due to the fact that the users weren't separated into two groups and instead were allowed freedom to make their own choices about how to play the game presenting an issue with getting a sizable results base to draw a conclusion. 

		However it could be argued that splitting the users into two separate groups could remove a key part in user mind set, but this is only a theoretical bias but it is worth mentioning for consideration in future user testing scenarios.

		The main result I have found was about the practical nature of the games UI as the majority of users didn't notice the all of the UI elements for the game through normal play, one of the major changes to the UI is to keep it more central to the screen rather than locked away in the corners. It's my understanding from the results I did get that users didn't spend a lot of time looking around the screen instead tending to only look at the obstacles directly ahead of them. This idea could be tested with the use of any eye tracking equipment, it's also worth noting that in any future tests a question worth asking is how heavily did not noticing the UI effect their overall enjoyment of the game.
