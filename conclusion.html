          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
		  The results I received were unfortunately inconclusive and weren't particularly suitable for use. This is largely due to the fact that the users weren't separated into two groups and instead were allowed freedom to make their own choices about how to play the game. This did bring up an interesting question about the usability of the game as the majority of users didn't notice the UI elements for the game through normal play, one of the major changes to the UI is to keep it more central to the screen rather than locked away in the corners. It's my understanding from the results I did get that users didn't spend a lot of time looking around the screen instead tending to only look at the obstacles directly ahead of them.
