          <h2>Discussion on the method</h2>
		  Although I was able to get some results from my research I found that my set up for gathering research was unfairly biased. The methods however did prove effective and had the testing period been more controlled and done in batches of users who were told to read the instructions against users who were told not to read the instructions. The results could have been more fair, although preliminary candidate screening would be necessary to ensure that both participating groups were not completely separate.

		  <h2>Discussion on the results </h2>
		  The results I recived were not quite what I was expecting as very few users actually looked at the instructions for the game, however some did look at the instructions after their first attempt though with prior experience with the game the results of this session would be invalid as a result of them already having experience with the game. 
		  The inital assumption for the question of do users who read the instructions also have a higher chance of identiing all the UI elements on screen, I had expect a more conclusive result from my testing which would show users who took the time to understand the controls and the game, would also take some time to observe more of the on-screen elements.
