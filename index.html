          <h2> This study follows the learnability of the game Hyper HeatWave Runner, mainly focusing on a correlation between users who decided to read the instructions and users who did not. The aim of this study is to see if users who read the instructions had a more clear understanding to what was happening in the game than those who had not.

The game Hyper Heatwave Runner was a game jam game, and features a simple endless runner style of gameplay. This is ideal as it doesn't encumber the user with large complex systems allowing for less time to understand how to play the game, while still being nuanced enough to have a learning curve. </h2>
