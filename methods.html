          <h2>Quantitative Research Method</h2>
       I will be carrying out observations on the subjects about how they decided to play the game. Noting if they read the instructions, what pick-ups they collected, and their total score multiplier at the end of the game. These observations will be carried out on a single subject at a time, without other subjects being allowed prior access to the game. This ensures that the subjects remain unbiased with prior knowledge of the test material. 

	It's worth noting some of the other methods that were considered during the planning stage of the Usability testing <a href="https://ajet.org.au/index.php/AJET/article/view/2075/1011/">advantages and disadvantages of various methods</a>

          <h2>Qualitative Research Method</h2>
        After each test I will be carrying out an interview with the subjects, this will be to determine what UI elements they were aware of during their play session while also asking users who read the instruction if they felt that the instructions help prepare them for the game and if they were able to easily identify the what was happening on screen.
