		<h2> Results </h2>
		The initial results I received showed that there is no real correlation between users looking at the instructions and then being able to identify all of the UI elements, as shown in the charts below. This could be largely to do with the testing methodology having an unfair bias.

          <h2> Other Notable Results </h2> 
		From verbal feedback from the users they found that it was very unclear when playing the game how they were doing with regards to health, score and their multiplier. Although this was not the information that I intended to collect I think it is worth noting that the UI elements seemed very difficult to pay attention to while playing the game, which presents an opportunity for a separate research project.
		
		All the users who took part in the test hit play again almost immediately after the test was completed and although this data wasn't included in the results it's worth noting that users seemed to want to continue playing.
